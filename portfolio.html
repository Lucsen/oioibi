	    <p>Abstraction is essentially the seperation between a program and its underlying code.
      In my program instance although it seems like a simple program where you only have to enter
      a few words and you get a response. While in actuality hours were put into the construction
      of the loops, and making sure there were no outstanding bugs. In a more broad sense even a programming
      language like python is a form of abstraction. Python,and most other programming languages are just a simplification
      of an underlying code that your computer can use, sometimses this simplification prosessc an go multiple layers deep.
      From my program, to python,to an underlying source code, all the way down to a machine code where it is processed and
      sent back up the ladder.</p>
